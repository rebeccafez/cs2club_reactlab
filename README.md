# CS^2 Club: React Lab

This is a lab I created to teach the React frontend web framework for the
Computer Science and Cybersecurity club at the County College of Morris.

## Setup

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed.

Once Node is installed, fork and clone this repository, and run `npm install` to
get the dependencies for this project.

Run `npm run start` and go to [localhost 1234](http://localhost:1234) to make
sure everything is working correctly. You should see a simple "Hello World."

Modify the contents of the `h1` tag in `src/App.js` while the development server
is still running. You should see the text on the webpage change.

## Lab

Once the template is working, use the [React Docs](https://react.dev/learn) to
learn the concepts of React.

Once you have some familiarity with how React is used, use this template to
create a simple to-do list app.
